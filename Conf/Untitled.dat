#----------------------------------------------
#	Initial Configuration
#----------------------------------------------
#----------------------------------------------

#HomeTestDistance
# This is the threshold distance between the determined home position and the
# current vehicle position that determines whether the home is OK.
# Default is 5.0m
# Units: metres
#HomeTestDistance 5

#NumWindTestCircles int_numreps
# This is the number of circles to fly at the takeoff rally point in order
# to get a decent determination of the wind direction.
# This information is then used if the waypoints are to be used as a bounding box
# and the aircraft will be generating its own flight path.
# Units: Scalar - number of circles
NumWindTestCircles 2

#MinimumBatteryLevel float_v
# This is the minimum voltage the system is allowed to read on the main flight pack
# before commencing a landing.
# If this is set too low, the AP's own failsafes will likely kick in first.
# Units: Volts
#MinimumBatteryLevel 10.6

#	Launch Configuration
#----------------------------------------------
#----------------------------------------------

#Takeoff_to_NavAlt float_alt
# The altitude at which the aircraft transitions from takeoff mode to survey mode
# if the system is using the included waypoints directly.
# If the waypoints are being used as a bounding box, the transition happens after
# several loiter circles (specified by NumWindTestCircles) at the takeoff rally point and altitude
# Units: metres above launch
#Takeoff_to_NavAlt 50

# Fixed_TO_Rally
# If this flag is set, the system will use the takeoff rally point below.
# Otherwise, it will be set to home.
# Units: scalar flag
Fixed_TO_Rally 0

#Takeoff_Rally float_lat float_lon
# The position of the rally point the aircraft moves to following takeoff.
# The default is the home position calculated on startup.
# Units: Lat Lon in decimal degrees
Takeoff_Rally 43.111573 -79.297302

#Takeoff_Airspeed float_airspeed
# The target airspeed of the aircraft during takeoff as it approaches and hits the
# takeoff rally point.
# Units: m/s relative airspeed.
Takeoff_Airspeed 12

#Takeoff_Radius float_Takeoff_Radius
#Takeoff_Alt float_Takeoff_Alt
#Home_Alt float_Home_Alt
#Home_Position float_Takeoff_Alt

#ImmediateLaunch int_flag
# This flag is used to set whether the aircraft will immediately launch once it has
# completed its startup and configuration steps.
# Caution should be used if the aircraft is set to launch automatically.
# Setting this to a non-zero number will put the aircraft in takeoff mode automatically.
# Units: scalar flag
ImmediateLaunch 1

#----------------------------------------------
#	Landing Configuration
#----------------------------------------------
#----------------------------------------------

#LandApproachLength float_distance
# The distance from the target land point to the rally point.
# The default is 200m.
LandApproachLength 0

#	Survey Configuration
#----------------------------------------------
#----------------------------------------------

#AltMode flag
# Can be one of:
# ComputedAltitude (based on GroundRes)
# SelectedAlt (use altitudes from waypoints or SureyAlt below)
AltMode ComputedAltitude

#SurveyAlt Alt
# The flight altitude used during the survey
# The altitude is in metres above launch altitude
# Units: m above launch
SurveyAlt 80

#GroundRes Res
# This will be used by the plane to select an altitude to fly for bounded surveys if selected to do so
# Given in cm per pixel
GroundRes 16

#CaptureOverlap Fraction
# How much overlap do we need (in longitudional and lateral sides)
# This is a fraction of image. It is used to determine appropriate transect width.
# Units: scaler (0.x)
CaptureOverlapAlongTransect 0.0
CaptureOverlapBetweenTransects 0.0

#SurveyAirSpeed airspeed
# The relative airspeed flown during the survey.
# Units: m/s relative airspeed
SurveyAirSpeed 0

#SurveyRepetitions int_flag
# The number of times to repeat the survey flight (battery life permitting).
# if this value is set negative, the plane will continue to fly the survey continuously.
# Units: scalar - number of repetitions
SurveyRepetitions 0

#SurveyMode - this is new, will be incorporated
# What type of survey to fly.
# Can be one of:
# BOX - plane assume a square box with the length specified below by "BoxSideLength"  - Can be moved in the field
# BOUNDED - plane uses given GPS coordinates as vertices of a bounded area
# LINEAR - plane will fly through given GPS coordinates in order
SurveyMode BOUNDED

#BoxSideLength float_len
# This variable dictates the length of one side of the box survey in metres. If
# a box survey is not flown (BoxSurvey 0) this value is not used.
# default length is 300m.
# Units: m above launch
BoxSideLength 0

#WP Lat Lon
# A waypoint. As many of these can be entered as desired.
# These can be either a series of waypoints for the flight plan
# or they can be the bounding box for a flight plan calculated later.
# The order entered is the order flown (if a linear flight).
# Units: Lat Lon in decimal degrees
#WP 43.825252 -79.399952
# -- OR
#WPA 43.825252 -79.399952 100 (if an altitude is desired for each. The alt is overriden in box or bounded surveys by SurveyAlt var)
